# Game

A [CYOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) game made in Java! This is a self-imposed challange using what I know of the language. It's function is to create a great end product and learn more about Java.

## How to run it

Just run the crun.bat file. This will compile all .java files in a test folder and run it for you :).
